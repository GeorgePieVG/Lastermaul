This directory contains the texture lump generation script. This is used
to generate the TEXTURE1, TEXTURE2 and PNAMES lumps. The Doom engine uses
these lumps on startup to build the game's wall textures from individual
patch textures. More information can be found on the Doom wiki:

    <http://doomwiki.org/wiki/TEXTURE1_and_TEXTURE2>

The deutex tool contains its own texture builder. However, due to the
specific requirements of the Freedoom project, we have implemented our
own texture lump builder. See the header comments in the build-textures
script for more information.
