Font Name	: Shatterhand
Font Size	: Smallfont
Base		: From scratch
Information	: This is a custom font I made for Snake's megawad called
			  "Unholy Realms".  The font was made to be a sort of heavy
			  metal gothic style, somewhat inspired by the Unreal Tournament
			  logo font.
			  
			  Becauase of its highly stylized design, it can be a bit funky
			  to read.
