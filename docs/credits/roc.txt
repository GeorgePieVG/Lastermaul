Description             : Realms Of Cronos is a community hub for Hexen designed for GZDoom. It includes extra textures, decorations, and monsters. Your journey begins in the sprawling ruins of K'char. Once a bustling city, it contains many portals to important destinations on Cronos. Previously forgotten and locked away, they've suddenly become all-too active with traffic from evil undead creatures. Nine different ambassadors have sent reported monsters invading from the old portals. There are even rumors that an entire ebony fortress has risen from the sea nearby. As the most powerful mercenary of the Arcanum, Legion, or Church, you've been handed a one-way ticket to the ruins and must seek out the root of the invasion.
