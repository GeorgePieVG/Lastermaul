Description             : Riding on the coat-tails of the last two community-
                          made MIDI Packs, this project, like them, seeks for
                          the community's finest musos to compose a megawad's
                          worth of original MIDI music for 2003 megawad
                          "Doom 2: The Rebirth" by Bj√∂rn Ostmann, aka Vader.
                          
                          As "The Rebirth" already contains a select few new
                          tracks of its own, this pack contains slightly fewer
                          pieces than usual and is NOT a full replacement. It
                          is, however, still a full resource of custom music
                          for you to use in your own projects.
                          
Additional Credits to   : Every one of you who contributed. Great work,
                          all! :D

                          Vader for endorsement and feedback!

Get "Doom 2: The Rebirth" here: https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/megawads/rebirth


* IMPORTANT!*

Due to Rebirth1.wad containing its own selection of new music, please run the WADs in this order:

  Rebirth1.wad rebmidi.wad rebmidi-np.wad*
  (* if desired/using GZDoom)

Or the full roster of custom tracks will not play.


* Play Information *

Game                    : Doom 2
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes
Other game styles       : All
Difficulty Settings     : N/A

* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : Development started on 1 February 2017.
Editor(s) used          : Various MIDI sequencers
May Not Run With...     : Vanilla doom.exe because the music in the WAD is
                          .MID files, not .MUS files (although none of the
                          files come close to the 96kb limit). Works best
                          with PrBoom, MBF and ZDoom.

* Tracks *

NOTES:
Maps 3, 10, 12, 15 and 32 do not have replacement tracks.
Those slots have been left clear to allow for the original tracks for these maps (composed by Vader) to play.

Map 25 had a custom track shared with map 10, which was replaced with a new track to avoid duplication.
Map 30 initially had a custom Vader track too, which ended up also being replaced in this roster.
